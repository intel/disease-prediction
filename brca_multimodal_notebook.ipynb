    "# Multi-Modal Disease Prediction\n",
    "Many reference kits  in the bio-medical domain focus on a single-model and single-modal solution.

To overcome these limitations, we provide this multi-modal disease prediction reference kit.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This reference kit demonstrates one possible reference implementation of a multi-model and multi-modal solution. While the vision workflow aims to train an image classifier that takes in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) images, the natural language processing (NLP) workflow aims to train a document classifier that takes in annotation notes about a patient’s symptoms. Each pipeline creates prediction for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In the end, weighted ensemble method is used to create final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize an expert’s involvement in categorizing samples as normal, benign, or malignant, by developing and optimizing a decision support system that automatically categorizes the CESM with the help of radiologist notes.\n",

    "This Github repo describes a reference kit for multi-modal disease prediction in the biomedical domain. The kit provides an end-to-end solution for fine-tuning and inference using categorized contrast-enhanced mammography data and radiologists' notes to predict breast cancer diagnosis. The reference kit includes a vision workload that trains an image classifier using CESM images, and a NLP pipeline that trains a document classifier using annotation notes about a patient's symptoms. Both pipelines create predictions for the diagnosis of breast cancer, which are then combined using a weighted ensemble method to create a final prediction. The ultimate goal of the reference kit is to develop and optimize a decision support system that can automatically categorize samples as normal, benign, or malignant, thereby reducing the need for expert involvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a future work, we will use a postprocessing method that will ensemble the different domain knowledge at feature level and fine-tune a model that would increase the accuracy of the prediction, speed up the end-to-end execution time for fine-tuning and inference, and reduce the cost of computation.  \n",

    "#### Adopt to your dataset\n",
    "To deploy this reference use case on a different or customized dataset, you can easily modify the disease_prediction_baremetal.yaml file.
