    "# Multi-Modal Disease Prediction\n",
    "Many reference kits  in the bio-medical domain focus on a single-model and single-modal solution. Exclusive reliance on a single method has some limitations, such as impairing the design of robust and accurate classifiers for complex datasets. To overcome these limitations, we provide this multi-modal disease prediction reference kit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-modal disease prediction is an Intel  optimized, end-to-end reference kit for fine-tuning and inference. This reference kit implements a multi-model and multi-modal solution that will help to predict diagnosis by using categorized contrast enhanced mammography data and radiologists’ notes.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This reference kit demonstrates one possible reference implementation of a multi-model and multi-modal solution. While the vision workflow aims to train an image classifier that takes in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) images, the natural language processing (NLP) workflow aims to train a document classifier that takes in annotation notes about a patient’s symptoms. Each pipeline creates a prediction for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In the end, weighted ensemble method is used to create a final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize an expert’s involvement in categorizing samples as normal, benign, or malignant, by developing and optimizing a decision support system that automatically categorizes the CESM with the help of radiologist notes.\n",

Medical reports, written by radiologists, are provided for each case along with manual segmentation annotation for the abnormal findings in each image. As a preprocessing step, we segment the images based on the manual segmentation to get the region of interest and group annotation notes based on the subject and breast side. \n",
