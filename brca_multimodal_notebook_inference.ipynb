    "# Multi-Modal Disease Prediction\n",
    "Many reference kits  in the bio-medical domain focus on a single-model and single-modal solution. Exclusive reliance on a single method has some limitations, such as impairing the design of robust and accurate classifiers for complex datasets. To overcome these limitations, we provide this multi-modal disease prediction reference kit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-modal disease prediction is an Intel  optimized, end-to-end reference kit for fine-tuning and inference. This reference kit implements a multi-model and multi-modal solution that will help to predict diagnosis by using categorized contrast enhanced mammography data and radiologists’ notes.\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "This reference kit demonstrates one possible reference implementation of a multi-model and multi-modal solution. While the vision workflow aims to train an image classifier that takes in contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) images, the natural language processing (NLP) workflow aims to train a document classifier that takes in annotation notes about a patient’s symptoms. Each pipeline creates prediction for the diagnosis of breast cancer. In the end, weighted ensemble method is used to create final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to minimize an expert’s involvement in categorizing samples as normal, benign, or malignant, by developing and optimizing a decision support system that automatically categorizes the CESM with the help of radiologist notes.\n",

    "## Validated Hardware Details\n",
    "There are workflow-specific hardware and software setup requirements depending on how the workflow is run. Bare metal development system and Docker image running locally have the same system requirements. \n",
